# cv_csharp
school project chartview version

# required
.NET 9(.0.2)

raylib, Raylib-cs and System.IO.Hashing from NuGet (if somehow they are not in the project)

# notes
you do not need to drag any mp3 files manually into the window!

if not using prebuilt, copy assets folder into same folder as executable (required for custom font, otherwise uses raylib default)
